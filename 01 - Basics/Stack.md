The MEAN stack is fairly common:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Angular.js
* MongoDB

This is where 'FULL STACK' Developer comes from - FYI.

Layers of the Full-Stack
* Server, Network, and Hosting
  * file system usage, cloud storage, network resources, data redundancy, data availability
* Data Modeling
  * If Data Model is flawed, ugly/strange code becomes necessary to compensate
  * Create a normalized relational model with foreign keys, indexes, views, look-up tables
  * familiar with non-relational data stores as well (Useful in some cases)
* Business Logic
  * Object Oriented Skills are usually required here.
  * frameworks are probably necessary here as well.
* API Layer (Action Layer)
  * How the outside world operates with the business logic & data model
  * Frameworks heavily required here
  * Developer NEEDS to write clear, consistent, and simple to use interfaces here.
* User Interface
  * Readable Layout
  * Mastery of html and css
* User Experience
  * The web app "just works" 
  * doesn't give its users carpal tunnel or sore eyes (ie. take a process that requires 8 clicks and 3 steps, and reduce it to 1 click)
  * When errors occur, the error message is USEFUL
*
